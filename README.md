Title: Design and devolop a digital website
---

# This is my Sony-wh-1000xm4 project

### About my project
    * We wanted to make a website about the Sony Wh-1000xm4 because it can help out people looking for a pair of new highend headphones. My partner and I who were     working on the website are both owners of this pair of wirless noise cancelling headphones. So it is better that we can also give an owners experiance of this spectacular pair of Headphones. BOOM!!!
    
    We wanted to give a thorough Paragraph of information to the viewer of this website so they are clear of what they are spending their money on. I was once also in the stage of trying to find a good pair of headphones and I always used helpfull websites to find Information.
