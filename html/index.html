                   This pair of headphones have a sleek minimalist design that only weighs in at unimaginable 254 gm, with this small weight and soft ear cups/pads, you may even forget these are on your head. Though that only may happen when you’re not listening to music with the headphones' amazing and clear sound, with punchy bass.
 
Another great thing about these headphones is the fact that you can adjust basically anything in them via the app-Headphones connect, which will help you set up things like alexa and noise canceling. That's what introduces the next great thing… the industry leading noise canceling, which will block out all noise and keep the clear voices around you up. These are just some of the great features. Although they’re worth $400, you won’t regret a single penny.
 
 These Sony WH-1000XM4 headphones are a very high end pair of headphones packed with spectacular features, but the thing that may put many people off is the heavy price tag.</sub>
